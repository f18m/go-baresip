// Package gobaresip provides a Go interface to the Baresip SIP client (https://github.com/baresip).
// This package allows you to control Baresip, send commands, and receive events and responses.
// It is designed to be used in applications that require SIP functionality, such as VoIP clients
// or SIP-based communication systems.
//
// For an example of how to use this package, see the example in the
// `examples` directory.
//
// The package provides a [Baresip] struct that represents a Baresip instance and methods
// to configure it, start it, and interact with it. Looking at the [Baresip] documentation is
// the recommended way to understand the available commands and events.
